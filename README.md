## Questions

### Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.
It is not the most significant achievement in my career but it is the one that I remember the most. I started my internship with a company, and I was assigned tasks to solve easy bugs in the application that didn't impact the team. The third task that I got was about loading a field in a form window that was always empty and it should get the information from the database. When I started to analyze the task came across the fact that the information wasn't even in the database even was expected to be saved. It was not in the data model. When I reported this fact, my supervisor told me if I was able to propose a solution to that issue, I accepted the challenge and in my first month in my team, I could analyze the data model, generate a solution that would impact the less and nowadays it still works and helps the nurses to do their job.

### Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)
